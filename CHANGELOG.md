### Added

- Turn-based battle: 4 party vs 1–4 enemies, turn order by speed (Godot 4).
- Battle UI: turn order bar, party/enemy slots in "> <" formation, party status panel, actions (Attack / End Turn), battle log.
- Sci-fi theme: dark gradient + grid background, cyan accents, styled panels and buttons.
- BattlerStats resource; BattleManager (logic) and BattleScene (UI); BattlerSlot with placeholder image (scene default + load fallbacks).
- Window 1920×1080; placeholder character image in scene so it loads reliably.
- Documentation: `docs/` (architecture, battle system, file reference, scenes/UI, placeholder image). Inline comments in scripts.
- Repo polish: `.gitignore`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`, `SECURITY.md`, `.github/` (CODEOWNERS, issue/PR templates).
