# Documentation

- **Language:** All project documentation and in-code comments must be in **English** (no Portuguese in docs or comments).
- **Keep docs in sync:** When you change battle logic, UI, scenes, or add features, update the relevant file in `docs/` so behaviour and structure are accurately described:
  - `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` — who creates what, signal flow, styling
  - `docs/BATTLE_SYSTEM.md` — turn flow, attack resolution, where it’s implemented
  - `docs/SCENES_AND_UI.md` — scene tree, BattlerSlot layout, theme, turn bar
  - `docs/FILE_REFERENCE.md` — purpose of each script, scene, asset
- **Index:** `docs/README.md` has quick links and a short “Keeping docs in sync” section; update it if you add new doc files.
